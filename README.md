## This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I made this project in order to get a better understanding of ReactJs.

In the project I used ES6 JavaScript (arrow functions, .map, etc.). I've got a better understanding of 
2 ways binding , which I used to get a better control over the input.

I also got a better understanding over animations and keyframes;
